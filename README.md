This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on an Intel/Altera Cyclone II FPGA. The project demonstrates a hardware-accelerated approach to neural network processing, focusing on simplicity and efficiency for rapid, low-power processing.

## üß† Network Architecture

The ANN is structured with three layers: an **input layer**, a **hidden layer**, and an **output layer**. This architecture is designed for basic pattern recognition tasks.

* **Input Layer**: Takes six 3-bit signed inputs (`i1` to `i6`).
* **Hidden Layer**: Contains two neurons that process the outputs from the input layer.
* **Output Layer**: A single neuron that generates the final 8-bit result.

The **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** function is used as the activation function at each layer. This simplifies computations by converting any negative value to zero, which is highly efficient for hardware implementation.

## üíª Hardware & Software

### Hardware
* **FPGA Board**: Altera Cyclone II.
* **Inputs**: 18 physical switches are used to provide the six 3-bit signed inputs.
* **Outputs**: 8 onboard LEDs are used to display the final 8-bit binary output.

### Software
* **HDL**: The design is written in **Verilog HDL**.
* **Synthesis & Implementation**: **Intel Quartus II** was used to compile, synthesize, and program the design onto the FPGA.
* **Simulation**: **ModelSim** was used for functional verification of the Verilog code before hardware deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Inputs and Outputs
* The network processes six parallel inputs, each being a **3-bit signed value** (limited to -1, 0, and 1).
* The final output is an **8-bit unsigned binary value** displayed on the LEDs.

### Weights and Biases
For simplicity and resource efficiency, all weights (`w1` to `w9`) and biases (`b1` to `b6`) are **pre-defined and hardcoded directly into the Verilog module**. This avoids the need for complex on-chip training logic or external memory for storing parameters. The values are initialized in an `initial` block within the Verilog code.
