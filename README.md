# Verilog-Implementation-of-an-ANN
This project implements a neural network on a Cyclone II FPGA using Verilog. It processes six 3-bit signed inputs through a hidden layer using the ReLU activation function. The design demonstrates an efficient, hardware-accelerated ANN with predefined weights, ideal for low-power applications.
